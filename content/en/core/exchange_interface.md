description: 'Information on the usage of the exchange interface class'
position: 12
version: 1.0
category: Framework

## Theory

The interface class provides a consistent way of interacting with the supported exchanges.

**The idea is that as long as scripts aren't using "exchange specific" information, if all calls are run through here, then it gives the developer the ability to** ***instantly switch between exchanges***. The backtesting framework also requires that the calls are made through the interface.

This means a few things about the information through the Interface:

- **Pre-typed.** Information guaranteed by the interface comes pre-casted. Most information sent from API's comes as strings, but the interface class converts these for easy access.
- **Less Detailed.** Different exchanges give different data. We try to pick out the most important bits of information to conecrate on maintaining, but some of it will end up in the `exchange_specific` tag on the dictionary returned.
- **Multiple API Calls**. Sometimes to accumulate the data required to tell the user everything they need to know, it requires multiple API calls to be run in the background.
- **Supports Paper Trading & Backtesting**. To use paper trading & backtesting features all calls must be run through the interface. 

The interface can grow and change based on user feedback - if you see an important feature we're missing, tell us in the GitHub issues page.

## Creation

Interfaces are pre-generated when an `exchange` object is created. They can then be accessed by using `.get_interface()` on an exchange:

```python
import blankly

exchange = blankly.CoinbasePro()  # This can be .Binance() or .Alpaca() or anything else supported

interface = exchange.get_interface()  # Use the getter

print(interface.get_account())
```

## Rest API Functions

### `get_calls()`

Get the direct RESTful exchange object that the interface is using. 

**Where is my IDE linting (autocomplete)?**

If you want **easy linting**, its better to use an exchange object and use `.get_direct_calls()`

You can also create linting by assigning it one of these types depending on which is accurate context:

- `from blankly.exchanges.interfaces.coinbase_pro.coinbase_pro_api import API`
- `from blankly.exchanges.interfaces.binance.binance_api import API	`
- `from blankly.exchanges.interfaces.alpaca.alpaca_api import API`

### `get_exchange_type()`

Determine which exchange an interface is running on.

#### Response

### `.cash -> float`

Get the amount of cash (generally the quote currency) inside the portfolio. This default quote can be set in the `settings.json` file for each exchange independently. This is used as a shortcut for easily determining buying power when making a transaction. This property is configurable because users may be using a variety of cash quotes such as `USD`, `USDT`, `USDC` or `EUR`. See [here](/usage/settings.json#format). Usage of this is discouraged if trading more complex assets such as `BTC-ETH`.

### Response

A single float which represents the size value of the account defined in `settings.json`.
