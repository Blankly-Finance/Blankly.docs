# Interface

## Theory

The interface class provides a consistent way of interacting with the supported exchanges.

**The idea is that as long as scripts aren't using "exchange specific" information, if all calls are run through here, then it gives the developer the ability to** ***instantly switch between exchanges***. The backtesting framework also requires that the calls are made through the interface.

This means a few things about the information through the Interface:

- **Pre-typed.** Information guaranteed by the interface comes pre-casted. Most information sent from API's comes as strings, but the interface class converts these for easy access.
- **Less Detailed.** Different exchanges give different data. We try to pick out the most important bits of information to conecrate on maintaining, but some of it will end up in the `exchange_specific` tag on the dictionary returned.
- **Multiple API Calls**. Sometimes to accumulate the data required to tell the user everything they need to know, it requires multiple API calls to be run in the background.

# Rest API Functions

## get_calls()

Get the direct RESTful exchange object that the interface is using. 

**Where is my IDE linting (autocomplete)?**

If you want **easy linting**, its better to use an exchange object and use `.get_direct_calls()`

You can also create linting by assigning it one of these types depending on which is accurate context:

- `from Blankly.exchanges.Coinbase_Pro.Coinbase_Pro_API import API	`
- `from Blankly.exchanges.Binance.Binance_API import API	`
- `from Blankly.exchanges.Alpaca.Alpaca_API import API`

## get_exchange_type()

Determine which exchange an interface is running on.
